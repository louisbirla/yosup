# Yosup

Yosup is an app made for the purpose of learning libp2p technology, asynchronous rust, ways to incorporate a single protocol over multiple interfaces, and cryptography.

To learn more about libp2p, visit [their hompage](https://libp2p.io/). Learn a bit about P2P networks, Peers and PeerIds, and whatnot.

## Easy-cmd

Easy-cmd is a simple implementation of Yosup that utilizes the simple stdin and out of the command line. For more information, check out [./easy_cmd/help.md](./easy_cmd/help.md)!

To get started with this, clone this repository and run `cargo run`. In the future, there will be better ways, but for now it's just for developers.
